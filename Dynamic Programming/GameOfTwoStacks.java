/*
 *  Problem: Find the maximum number of elements you can remove from two stacks such that their sum doesn't exceed a given maximum.
    (https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/game-of-two-stacks/problem)
    Approach: Recursive solution with memoization that explores taking elements from either stack at each step.

    Time Complexity: O(n × m × maxSum)
    Space Complexity: O(n × m × maxSum)
